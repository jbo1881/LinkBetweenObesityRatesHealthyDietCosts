# Obesity Daily Healthy Costs

## Description

Exploring the Relationship Between Obesity Rates and Daily Healthy Diet Costs Across Countries: Insights and Implications.

### Data Retrieval and Preprocessing

The project utilizes Python to analyze data on obesity rates and daily healthy diet costs across various countries. The data is sourced from FAOSTAT for healthy diet costs (2021), obesity rates from World Population Review (2024), and population from the Kaggle World Population Dataset (2022). Data preprocessing involves cleaning, merging, and handling missing values.

### Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed to visualize the relationship between obesity rates and healthy diet costs. A scatter plot is created, where the x-axis represents healthy diet costs, the y-axis represents obesity rates, and markers are sized according to population. Country names are annotated for clarity.

### Technologies Used

The project leverages Python for data analysis and visualization, specifically utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting graphs.

## File Structure

The repository consists of the following files and directories:

- **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, methodologies, and technologies used.
- **main.py**: Contains the main Python script responsible for data retrieval, preprocessing, and visualization.
- **FAOSTAT.xls**: Dataset containing healthy diet costs sourced from FAOSTAT (2021).

**Additional Insights:**

The analysis reveals intriguing patterns in the relationship between obesity rates and healthy diet costs across countries. While some nations with cheaper healthy food options exhibit lower obesity rates, others maintain low rates despite higher costs. These findings underscore the complexity of factors influencing dietary habits and obesity prevalence, emphasizing the importance of nuanced public health strategies.
